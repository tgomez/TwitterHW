## What?
<p> Some say that the news is incredibly depressing. To explore this, I thought it would be interesting to run a sentiment analysis on several different news outlets and see if thier sentiment scores vary based on thier tweets on Twitter. 
</p>

## How?
<p> Picked 5 news outlets: "@BBCWorld", "@CBSNews", "@CNN", "@FoxNews","@nytimes" </p>
<p> Pulled the last 100 tweets for each account </p>
<p> Utilized vaderSentiment to analyze sentiment</p>
<p> Plotted results to visually analyze sentiment</p> 

## Observations
<p> The last 100 tweets for all five news outlets analyzed have an overall negative sentiment. </p>
<p> BBCWorld has the most negative score of the five new outlets analyzed. </p>
<p> Fox News has the least negative score of the five new outlets analyzed. </p>
